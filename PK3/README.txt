Maps 2.0 by LJ Sonic
====================


Overview
========


Maps is a collaborative 2D level editor, entirely built using the HUD (literally).

It has support for saving/loading maps to files,
and PLANNED support for custom tilesets and saving/loading to a PK3.

It it not compatible with other add-ons (except sound/music replacements).
Splitscreen is not supported.
OpenGL mode is not officially supported but seems to work alright for most part.
Although this mod is primarily intended for multiplayer, singleplayer is still supported as a side-effect.
